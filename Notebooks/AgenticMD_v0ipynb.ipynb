The patient may have already described one or more components of OLDCARTS (Onset, Location, Duration, Character, Aggravating factors, Relieving factors, Timing, Severity, Temporality). After you gather this initial data, you should identify what is missing and only ask for the outstanding details. If certain critical points remain ambiguous or incomplete after the patient’s responses, you may ask up to three brief clarifying questions.

This is consistent with the aggravation occurring during jogging, as physical activity can lead to increased circulation and pressure.\n",

            "1. **Allergic Otitis Media**: The patient’s symptoms of fullness and pressure in the ear canal, along with a suspected allergy to their cat, suggest an allergic reaction potentially leading to inflammation in the middle ear. The aggravation while jogging could be due to increased congestion or fluid movement.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction (ETD)**: This condition can cause a sensation of fullness and pressure in the ear and is often related to allergies or sinus issues. The constant nature of the symptoms supports this, especially if there's associated inflammation due to allergy.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Earwax Impaction**: The symptoms of hearing loss, fullness, and pressure could indicate a blockage caused by cerumen (earwax). The fact that sleeping on the affected side relieves some symptoms may suggest that the ear's position changes the impact of pressure caused by the wax.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Acute Allergic Rhinitis**: This could be contributing to sinus or ear pressure due to inflammation from allergens. Although the patient primarily reports ear symptoms, upper respiratory symptoms such as nasal obstruction, sneezing, or postnasal drip might be present but not mentioned.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Chronic Otitis Media**: Although the duration of symptoms is only two days, the pressure and hearing loss could be signs of infection; however, it seems less likely given the short duration and specific mention of allergic reaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ)**: If the ear fullness and pressure are coupled with jaw discomfort or changes in jaw motion (not reported), TMJ issues could be a consideration, especially as renal symptoms could mimic ear pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Missing information that could refine the differential includes:**\n",
            "- Presence of other symptoms (nasal congestion, itchiness, etc.)\n",
            "- History of similar issues or previous ear infections\n",
